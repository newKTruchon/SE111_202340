        <h1>Katie Truchon</h1>
        <p>Katie was born and raised by two <b>compassionate</b> and <i>patient</i> educators by the seaside in Narragansett, Rhode Island. From an early age she learned a love of animals, cultivates a habit of falling into fantastical worlds through reading, and always tries to carry a camera, notebook, and deck of cards with her.</p>

        <p>She is a super-fan of Game of Thrones and a self-proclaimed nerd.</p>

        <p>She spends most of her time with <u>her pack</u> comprised of Jack, George, and Marlowe.</p>
